                  <em>MEMOGAME</em> is an online card game, borrowing elements
                  from Concentration and Gin Rummy.

                <Paragraph>
                  The goal of <em>MEMOGAME</em> is to move all the cards from
                  your <em>STORAGE</em> pile into the <em>CENTER</em> pile. The{" "}
                  <em>CENTER</em> pile is shared with the other players, who are
                  also trying to do the same with their cards. The game ends
                  when any player gets all their cards into the center.

                <Paragraph>
                  To play a card, it has to MATCH the card thatâ€™s already there.
                  Cards can match in any of three ways: <em>Color</em>,{" "}
                  <em>Type</em> or <em>First Letter</em>.

                  If your top card doesn't match the center card, you can put it
                  into a room in your house.

                  There are SIX rooms in your house;{" "}
                  <em>Bedroom, Bathroom, Kitchen, Dining, Garage and Office</em>
                  . Each room can hold up to THREE cards. Once a card goes into
                  a room it remains there <em>face-down</em> until you play it
                  to the center.
                </Paragraph>
                <Paragraph>
                  The only times you get to see cards in your house face-up are:
                  <br />
                  <b>1.</b> when adding another card to a room (you get a few
                  seconds to reorganize the room) and <br />
                  <b>2.</b> by "peeking" at it, which costs you a point each
                  time.

                  You can play a (face-down) card from your house at ANY time,
                  even when it is not your turn.

                  Each consecutive card you play from the house makes the
                  points-per-card value <em>climb</em>. So playing three cards
                  in a row from your house would get you{" "}
                  <em>
                    1 + 2 + 3 = <b>6</b>
                  </em>{" "}
                  points. Peeking or playing a card from your storage pile
                  resets that point climber.

                When a player has moved all their cards to the center so both
                their storage pile and house are empty, that player "goes out"
                and the game ends. Each of the players who still had cards left
                must <em>subtract</em> those cards from their score, and the
                player who went out <em>adds</em> all those points to his/her
                score.
